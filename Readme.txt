This Java project contains a simple program which finds a list of cities at
a certain latitude.

City data is located in a Derby database. The database is located in the
'locations' directory.  The database was created using the CreateDBScript
project (https://github.com/ctrowbridge/CreateDBScript.git). You shouldn't
need the CreateDBScript project unless you want to change the database
implementation.
